## I assessed deer density and herd composition trends from spotlight survey data collected between 2007 and 2022.


#### Figure 1. Estimated deer density (acres per deer) at four military training sites in Texas between 2007 and 2022.  A management goal for these herds is to maintain deer densities between 10 and 20 acres per deer, which is represented by the red shaded area.

#### Figure 2. Estimated buck to doe ratios at four military training sites in Texas between 2007 and 2022.  A management goal for these herds is to maintain buck to doe ratios at roughly 0.5, which is represented by a horizontal line.

#### Figure 3. Estimated Fawn to Doe ratio at four military training sites in Texas between 2007 and 2021.  A healthy fawn to doe ratio is 0.75 and is represented by a horizontal line.
